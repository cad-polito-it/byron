Byron is an [evolutionary tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm): given a problem, it first generates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and improves them using the results of their evaluations together with structural information.

Byron can solve problems that require solutions with a complex structures, such as realistic assembly programs with loops, interrupts, and recursive subroutines. It may be used as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) and a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), or as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas.

Candidate solutions are evaluated in parallel calling a user-defined Python function; creating temporary directories and using a [*makefile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)); or executing a generic shell script (that may, for instance, call proprietary tools).

## Installation

**⚠️ Byron is currently in [pre-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) and under active development**

```
pip install --upgrade byron
```

Few optional dependencies can enhance Byron, but are not strictly required:

```
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
pip install --upgrade joblib
