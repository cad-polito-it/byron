### Join the team

Please, contact Alberto or Giovanni directly:

* If you enjoy playing with Python and Evolutionary Computation, and you are looking for a 6-month master thesis. Note: We are **always** looking for valuable students, even when there are no theses posted on the official channels.
* If you have a great idea for an improvement, but you are not sure how to hack it.
* If you feel like doing it.

### Reports

We use [GitHub's issues](https://github.com/squillero/byron/issues) for bug reporting. 

If you have published a paper using any version of byron, please let us know.

Anyhow, feel free to send us an email describing your story. 

### Coding

#### TL;DR

* The default branch is always the more stable
* Do not clone experimental branches `exp/*` unless you know what you are doing
* Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/python.md) and keep the code formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Write as few lines of code and as much line of comments as possible (ie. use builtins, exploit generators and list comprehension)
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unit testing (ie. `coverage run -m pytest`)
* Use [pylint](https://mypy-lang.org/) for basic linting and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for additional type checking
* Be [paranoid](./PARANOIA.md) (cit. *"I need someone to show me the things"*)
* It may be wise to contact Alberto or Giovanni 

## Money Donations

Thanks for trying, but we do not accept monetary donations:

* Alberto and Giovanni are working on byron as an integral part of their research activities. Therefore, they are already paid by their institutions, namely: *Politecnico di Torino* (Italy); *INRAE — AgroParisTech* (France) and *Institut des Systèmes Complexes de Paris Île-de-France* (France).
* Students have worked, are working, and will work on byron as part of their academic curricula, either for Master's theses or Ph.D. programs.
* A few volunteers did excellent work on specific topics, but as volunteers they did not ask for payment.

So, why not donating [**time**](#join-the-team) instead of money?
