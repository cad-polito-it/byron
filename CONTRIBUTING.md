Contribute to Byron
===================

#### First of all, thank you! :+1:

Generally speaking there are several ways to contribute:

##### * Create/Extend/update/proofread the documentation

Contact Alberto or Giovanni if your English is acceptable and you want to play with documentation generators such as [Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)). Some of these works could even be considered *small dissertations* (tesine) in Politecnico di Torino.

##### * Add a brand new feature
##### * Improve an existing feature

Contact Alberto or Giovanni if you enjoy playing with Python and Evolutionary Computation, and you are looking for a 6-month master thesis. Start sharpening your favorite IDE.

**Note**: We are always looking for valuable students, even when there are no theses posted on the official channels.

##### * Use the tool and report a success story

Let us know if you have published a paper using any version of byron or MicroGP (Byron's predecessor). 

**Note**: Byron's official DOI is not available, yet.

##### * Fail to use the tool and [submit a bug report](#report)

We plan to use [GitHub's issues](https://github.com/cad-polito-it/byron/issues) for bug reporting. 

##### * [Fix a bug](#coding)

Kudos!

##### * Draw logo/icons

Byron is still missing a nice logo. 

##### * [~~Donate money~~](#money-donations)

Thanks for trying, but we do not accept monetary donations:

* Alberto and Giovanni are working on Byron as an integral part of their research activities. Therefore, they are already paid by their institutions, namely: *Politecnico di Torino* (Italy); *INRAE — AgroParisTech* (France) and *Institut des Systèmes Complexes de Paris Île-de-France* (France).
* Students have worked, are working, and will work on Byron as part of their academic curricula, either for Master's theses or Ph.D. programs.
* A few volunteers did excellent work on specific topics, but as volunteers they did not ask for payment.
