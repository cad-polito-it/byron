Byron is an [evolutionary tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm): given a problem, it first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with structural information. 

Byron is able to tackle problem those solutions are simple fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines. It can be exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) and as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), or as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas.

Candidate solutions can seamlessly be evaluated in parallel using external scripts, for instance calling proprietary tools. 

### Installation

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Byron is currently in [pre-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) and under active development

```
pip install --upgrade byron
```

Optional dependencies which enhance *byron* , but are not strictly required:

```
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
pip install --upgrade joblib
pip install --upgrade psutil
```

### Notez Bien

This repo is only useful if you want to hack the code (see: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)). 

**TL;DR**

* The default branch is always the more stable
* Do not clone experimental branches `exp/*` unless you know what you are doing
* Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/python.md) and keep the code formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Write as few lines of code and as many lines of comments as possible (ie. use builtins, exploit generators and list comprehension)
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unit testing (ie. `coverage run -m pytest`)
* Use [pylint](https://mypy-lang.org/) for basic linting and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for additional type checking
* Be [paranoid](./PARANOIA.md) (cit. *"I need someone to show me the things"*)
* It may be wise to contact Alberto or Giovanni before trying to change anything
