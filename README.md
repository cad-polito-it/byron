MicroGP (µGP, `byron`)  is an [evolutionary tool](https://squillero.github.io/byron/evolution.html) created around 2001. Over the years it has been exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), and as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas. [Some hundreds documents](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+OR+byron3+OR+byron2+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+OR+Sanchez+OR+Schillaci+%29) discussing it and possible application can be found in the scientific literature.

This repo is only useful if you want to hack the code (see: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)). 

**TL;DR**

* The default branch is always the more stable
* Do not clone experimental branches `exp/*` unless you know what you are doing
* Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/python.md) and keep the code formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Write as few lines of code and as many lines of comments as possible (ie. use builtins, exploit generators and list comprehension)
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unit testing (ie. `coverage run -m pytest`)
* Use [pylint](https://mypy-lang.org/) for basic linting and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for additional type checking
* Be [paranoid](./PARANOIA.md) (cit. *"I need someone to show me the things"*)
* It may be wise to contact Alberto or Giovanni before trying to change anything
