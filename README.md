Byron is an [evolutionary tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm): given a problem, it first generates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and improves them using the results of their evaluations together with structural information.

Byron can solve problems that require solutions with a complex structures, such as realistic assembly programs with loops, interrupts, and recursive subroutines. It may be used as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) and a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), or as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas.

Candidate solutions are evaluated in parallel using a Python function, an external *makefile*, or a generic shell script that may, for instance, call proprietary tools.

### Installation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Byron is currently in [pre-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) and under active development**

```
pip install --upgrade byron
```

Optional dependencies which enhance *byron* , but are not strictly required:

```
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
pip install --upgrade joblib
pip install --upgrade psutil
```

### TL;DR

This repo is only useful if you want to hack the code (see: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)). 

* The default branch is always the more stable
* Do not clone experimental branches `exp/*` unless you know what you are doing
* Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/python.md) and keep the code formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Write as few lines of code and as many lines of comments as possible (ie. use builtins, exploit generators and list comprehension)
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unit testing (ie. `coverage run -m pytest`)
* Use [pylint](https://mypy-lang.org/) for basic linting and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for additional type checking
* Be [paranoid](./PARANOIA.md) (cit. *"I need someone to show me the things"*)
* It may be wise to contact Alberto or Giovanni before trying to change anything
